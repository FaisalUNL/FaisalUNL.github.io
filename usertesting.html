    <h1><strong>The Usability Testing Revolution</strong></h1>
    <h3><strong>Framework: #FreeFormm</strong></h3>

    <p><strong>In the past, testing if software was user-friendly was expensive, often requiring fancy labs and costing up to $50,000. But in 1989, Jakob Nielsen changed the game. He introduced a method that was much cheaper and simpler1. This shift was crucial; it meant that even those without huge budgets could refine and improve their creations. Nielsen's approach reminds us that good solutions can be simple and affordable. So, for creators, if you can't hire experts, don't be afraid to test and refine your work yourself.<br>

        Based on Jakob Nielsen's "Usability Engineering at a Discount" in 1989.</strong></p>
