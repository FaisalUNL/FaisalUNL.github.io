    <h1><strong>Visibility</strong></h1>

    <p><strong>Chapter 1 of "The Design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman primarily revolves around the concept of "visibility." I chose this word as it concisely represents the essence of Norman’s discourse in the chapter. Norman argues that the more visible an object’s functions are, the more likely users can understand how to use it. Visibility, in design terms, implies that by looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action. This concept is fundamentally important in any field where user interaction is a focus. Regardless of one's career, understanding that well-designed products and systems should make all needed options and materials for a given task visible and readily accessible is pivotal. This concept of visibility is key to creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, systems, and products, ultimately leading to enhanced user experiences and satisfaction.</strong></p>
