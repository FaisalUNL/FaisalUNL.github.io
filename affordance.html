    <h1><strong>Affordances</strong></h1>

    <p><strong>In Chapter 2 of “The Design of Everyday Things,” Don Norman introduces the concept of “affordances,” which refers to the perceived and actual properties of a thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used. I chose the word “affordances” as it succinctly encapsulates the core idea of the chapter, emphasizing how objects communicate their functionality and use to individuals, which is a crucial aspect of user-centered design. This concept is pivotal in any career related to design, product development, or any field where creating user-friendly items is essential. Recognizing and implementing affordances allows creators to develop products that are intuitive and user-friendly, reducing the user’s cognitive load and making the interaction more efficient and pleasant. In essence, a proper understanding and application of affordances are crucial for developing successful, user-centered designs and innovations.</strong></p>
