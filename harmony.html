    <h1><strong> Harmony </strong></h1>
    <h3><strong> using #1 of the framework </strong></h3>

    <p><strong>I chose the word "Harmony" because it encapsulates the symbiotic relationship between typography and color in any design tool, including Figma. In design, achieving balance and coherence between different elements, such as type and color, is pivotal in creating aesthetically pleasing and effective visual communications, and that is the thing that I dragged my attention in the video. Harmony in typography and color fosters readability, mood, and the transmission of the intended message, ensuring the success of the design.

        For me as a Front-end developer, remembering the concept of harmony is crucial. It acts as a foundation in creating visually compelling and user-friendly designs. Achieving harmony between typography and color ensures that the design elements complement each other and work together to convey the message or experience seamlessly and effectively, enhancing the overall user experience and satisfaction, which are pivotal in the success of any design project.</strong></p>
