    <h1><strong> Aurora: </strong></h1>
    <h2>using #WordJournal framework</h2>

    <p><strong>I’ve chosen the word “Aurora” because it explains deeply how the human eye and mind interpret different colors, combinations and reflect these colors into a smaller definition of beauty or sharpness. Colors can send messages, manipulate the emotions, and sometimes it can indicate a physical statement. For example, if someone sees a red color, they will interpret it as something that is hot in temperature, and this gives us an idea of the physiological and psychological complexity of color perception. As a person who loves the purple color, I find it fascinating how the vibe of this color changes dynamically by the change of its degree, and as the book refers “bluer purples are less sensual and more meditative”. In my career, colors is a big topic that need studies because as a front end developer this will help me a lot when it comes to picking the interface colors that can give the user a better experience. </strong></p>
