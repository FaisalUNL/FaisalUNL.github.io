<h1><strong>Figma Design and Prototyping Tutoria</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Framwork: Tutorial</strong></h3>

<p><strong>1- Basics of the Figma Interface:
    <ul>
    <li>Layers Panel: On the left, you'll see the layers panel which displays the hierarchy of your design elements.</li>
   <li> Properties Panel: On the right, you can adjust properties of the selected objects such as fill, stroke, effects, and layout.</li>
   <li> Canvas: The middle section is where you'll design your interfaces.  </li>
   <li> Toolbar: Located at the top, this contains tools for manipulating objects on the canvas. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    2- Designing:
    <li>Adding Shapes: Use the shape tools in the toolbar to add rectangles, ellipses, lines, etc.</li>
    <li> Click on the text tool and click on the canvas to add text.</li>
    <li>Images: Drag and drop images onto the canvas or use the image tool.</li>
   <li>Components: Create reusable design elements. Right-click an object and select "Create Component".</li>
    <br>
    3- Prototyping:
    <li>Frame: Before prototyping, it's helpful to have a 'Frame' which can act like a screen or page. Click on the frame tool, and choose a device size or create a custom-sized frame.</li>
    <li>Linking: To create an interactive prototype, select an object, and click on the 'Prototype' tab in the properties panel. Drag the small circle (noodle) that appears to the frame you want to link.</li>
    <li>Interactions: Once linked, you can set the interaction type, e.g., "On Click", "On Hover", etc. Choose the type of animation and how it transitions.</li>
   <li>Previewing: Click on the "Play" button in the top-right corner to view your prototype. This opens the prototype in a new window.</li>
   <br>
    4- Sharing and Collaboration:
    <li>Sharing Link: Click on the 'Share' button at the top right. You can send this link to others to get feedback or collaborate.</li>
    <li>Comments: In the shared prototype, viewers can click and add comments to specific parts of the design.</li>
    <br>
    6. Exporting:
   <li>Select Objects: Choose the objects or frames you want to export.</li>
   <li> Export Settings: In the properties panel on the right, click on the 'Export' option. Adjust settings like format (PNG, JPG, SVG) and size.</li>
   <li> Download: Click the export button to save to your computer.</li>
   <br>
    Conclusion:
    Figma is a versatile tool that combines design and prototyping into a single platform, making it easier for designers to bring their visions to life and collaborate with stakeholders. Remember to regularly explore Figma's community and resources, as they often release new features and updates.
