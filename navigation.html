    <h1><strong>Accessibility</strong></h1>
    <h2>using #WordJournal framework</h2>

    <p><strong>The word "Accessibility" encapsulates the essence of Chapter 6. The chapter emphasizes the importance of designing web pages that are not only usable but also easily accessible to every user, regardless of their abilities. Accessibility ensures that digital content is inclusive, allowing users with disabilities or other limitations to engage with content effectively. Remembering and prioritizing accessibility in one's career ensures that web designs and digital products cater to a broader audience, promoting inclusivity and removing barriers. This not only creates a better user experience but also underscores ethical design practices that respect the rights of all users.</strong></p>
