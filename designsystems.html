    <h1><strong>Typography</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The sections touch on the key components of typography in digital design: typeface selection, font weights/styles, and font sizes. As a digital designer or someone involved in the digital space, understanding typography is paramount. This isn't just about aesthetics â€“ it's about communication. The right typeface can subtly convey the intended tone and personality of a brand or message. Font weights and styles play a pivotal role in creating a clear hierarchy of information. Meanwhile, appropriate font sizes, line-heights, and responsiveness ensure content is legible and user-friendly across devices. As I advance in my career, remembering the significance of typography is essential, as it directly impacts user experience and brand perception.</strong></p>
