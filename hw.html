    <h1><strong>UIUN Negotiation Reflection</strong></h1>

    <p>
      <strong>
        In the workshop, I gained valuable insights into how people perceive and
        interact with various interfaces. This learning experience highlighted
        the common needs and preferences users may have.
        <br />
        Our exercise involved providing specific points for different sections
        such as Color Scheme, Body Heading, Main Page Header, etc. Each company
        was tasked with identifying a particular need of their target population
        and prioritizing it based on the urgency and relevance of that need.
        This initial phase was crucial in establishing a foundation for our
        subsequent discussions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once we listed our points, the next stage involved negotiating with
        other companies. The aim was to compare and prioritize our listed points
        against theirs. This negotiation process was dynamic; it involved
        convincing others of our viewpoint or being convinced by theirs.
        Interestingly, we also explored the possibility of merging our points
        with others to create solutions that could cater to a wider range of
        users.

        A significant part of the workshop was dedicated to website design for
        children under 13. It became clear that this demographic has specific
        developmental needs. For instance, their evolving literacy skills
        necessitate the use of simple language and intuitive navigation. They
        may also face challenges with tasks requiring fine motor skills,
        underscoring the importance of large, easy-to-click buttons. Based on
        these insights, my recommendation is to develop websites that are
        visually appealing yet educational. This can be achieved by using
        vibrant colors, interactive elements, and straightforward text and voice
        instructions. The design should also accommodate their motor skills
        through simple gestures and large touch targets.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our negotiation sessions were particularly engaging. We discussed points
        under categories like Dynamically Loaded Content, Main Page Header, and
        Button/Hyperlinks. These discussions required us to interact with
        various groups representing different interests, such as Non-Native
        users and Generation Z. One of the more challenging negotiations was
        with representatives from rural areas, especially regarding the
        Dynamically Loaded Content section. Ultimately, we reached a consensus,
        although we had to settle for Priority 2 instead of our initial goal of
        Priority 1.

        This summit was not just an academic exercise but also a fun and
        engaging way to learn about perspectives. I realized the importance of
        being patient, open-minded, and articulate when presenting my ideas.
        More importantly, I learned to appreciate and critically analyze
        viewpoints different from my own. These skills are not just valuable in
        professional settings like summits but are also applicable in everyday
        conversations.
