    <h1><strong>UIUN Negotiation Reflection</strong></h1>

    <p><strong>In this workshop, I have learned a lot of things that people might share in common when it comes to viewing a particular interface, and what might be their needs. The exercise proceeded when we had to provide points that served a particular section. For example, the sections included Color Scheme, Body Heading, Main Page Header, etc. Each company should provide a specific point that their population needs and they should prioritize it based on how fast they provide that point or idea initially. After we listed all our points, we had to negotiate with other companies about the priority of the points that we listed compared to the points that they listed, and they should either convince us or convince them. However, we can also negotiate to merge our points into one category which can serve both populations. When designing websites for children under 13, it's crucial to address their developmental needs. This age group typically has evolving literacy skills, so they benefit from simple language and intuitive navigation. They may struggle with tasks that require fine motor skills, making large, easy-to-click buttons essential. Based on these insights, I recommend creating a website that combines visual appeal with educational content, using vibrant colors and interactive elements to keep users engaged. It's also important to include straightforward text and voice instructions to aid understanding. To accommodate their motor skills, the design should feature simple gestures and large touch targets. The negotiation went well, we listed points in the Dynamically Loaded Content, Main Page Header, and Button/Hyperlinks sections. In all of these sections, we had to negotiate with different companies to share our interest in providing a suitable and appealing interface for all our populations. We had to talk to different groups such as Non-Native, Gen Z, and a few others to share the stage of priority. The hardest to discuss and to negotiate with is Rural because they were stiff when it came to convincing them in the Dynamically Loaded Content section. We ended up with Priority 2 instead of 1. Talking with people about your perspective and trying to convince them of your point of view is fun, especially when both parties are mature and open to discussing different areas of a certain topic. From this summit, I learned a lot, especially that I need to be patient and open to display my points carefully, also that I need to have a brighter image because the person with whom I am talking has a different point that I need to understand and critique. I think I can apply the skills that I learned not only in summits but even in daily conversations with people.</strong></p>
