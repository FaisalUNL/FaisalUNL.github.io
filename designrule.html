    <h1><strong>Clarity</strong></h1>

    <p><strong>Clarity is paramount in web design, as users predominantly scan pages and seldom read every word. Krug argues that designers should create pages and sites that are self-evident, where users can understand their workings with minimal thought. This is essential because if the user can’t find what they are looking for or doesn’t understand what is presented, they will leave.

        Choosing "Clarity" reflects the importance of making websites and interfaces clear, intuitive, and user-friendly. In any career related to web design, user interface (UI) design, or user experience (UX) design, remembering to prioritize clarity is pivotal. When designs are clear and intuitive, users can navigate and find the information they need effortlessly, leading to a more pleasant user experience and, ultimately, more effective websites, applications, or products. This concept is crucial to remember as it underlines the user-centric approach that is vital in designing successful and efficient interfaces and experiences.</strong></p>
