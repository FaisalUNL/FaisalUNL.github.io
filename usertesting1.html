    <h1><strong>Essential</strong></h1>

    <p><strong>Usability testing, as discussed by Krug, is not a luxury or an afterthoughtâ€”it's an essential component of user-centered design. The reason I'd choose this word is to emphasize the fundamental importance of usability testing in ensuring a product's success. Regardless of how expert or experienced a designer or developer might be, real user feedback is invaluable in catching unforeseen issues and understanding the user's perspective. As someone pursuing a career in design, development, or any related field, it's critical to remember that assumptions can often be incorrect. Usability testing keeps you grounded in the reality of user experience, ensuring that your work remains relevant, accessible, and effective.</strong></p>
