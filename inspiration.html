    <h1><strong>Finding Inspiration</strong></h1>

    <p><strong>
        1. Rule of Thirds: 
        <br>
Edward Hopper's compositions, much like those of his contemporaries in the "Sheldon Treasures," often utilized the rule of thirds, a principle that divides an image into nine equal segments. By placing points of interest along these lines or at their intersections, artists can create more tension, energy, and interest in their compositions than simply centering the subject. As noted by renowned photography and visual arts critic John Szarkowski, "The world now contains more photographs than bricks, and they are, astonishingly, all different. Those that we remember seem to remember us. They return as a sort of echo of our own experience.” (Szarkowski, J. Looking at Photographs. 1973). Hopper’s understanding and application of the rule of thirds set his works apart, allowing the viewer's eyes to naturally move through the painting in a way that resonates with human visual preference.

        2. Direction of the Eyes: 
        <br>
The direction in which subjects are looking in an artwork can heavily influence the viewer's emotional response and the narrative of the piece. Hopper often employed this tool to guide viewers' focus and evoke specific feelings. In many of Hopper's pieces, the characters seem introspective, their gazes directed away from the viewer or lost in distant thoughts, creating an air of mystery. Art historian Robert Hughes remarks, "Hopper's world is ... always intensely silent and still. And yet the stillness is charged, as though at any moment it might break.” (Hughes, R. American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America. 1997). This stillness and the direction of the eyes of his subjects contribute heavily to this charged atmosphere.

        3. Color Balance:
        <br>
Hopper’s color palettes are carefully crafted to set the mood of each piece. While his peers might have picked for bold and contrasting colors, Hopper often chose muted, harmonious colors, creating a sense of realism. Yet, within this framework, he brilliantly balanced colors to guide the viewer's attention and emphasize particular elements of a scene. In discussing the impact of color in art, Wassily Kandinsky once said, “Color is a power which directly influences the soul.” (Kandinsky, W. Concerning the Spiritual in Art. 1910). Hopper's skillful color balance showcases this power, manipulating viewers' emotions and immersing them into the stories depicted in his works.

The piece has inspired me to focus a lot on the "rule of third", I was able to list the main components mostly on the mid left and mid right instead of centering all objects. I learned a lot using these areas, a day of reading and viewing the art piece was very helpful to make me see things in a better way through sketching. </strong></p>
