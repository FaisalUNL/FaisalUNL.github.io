    <h1><strong>Usability</strong></h1>

    <p><strong>The focus is largely on usability testing, emphasizing its simplicity and necessity. I chose the word “Usability” as it encapsulates the essence of this chapter, centering around the practical aspects of user-friendly design and the importance of routine usability tests to identify and rectify issues. This concept is vital in any career related to web design or user experience (UX) because, without prioritizing usability, even the most aesthetically pleasing and innovative designs may fail to meet user needs and expectations, leading to reduced user satisfaction and engagement. The simplistic and user-centric approach outlined by Krug in conducting usability tests is fundamental to creating intuitive and efficient interfaces. By maintaining a focus on usability, professionals can ensure that they are meeting user needs and creating products that are accessible and enjoyable to a broad audience.</strong></p>
